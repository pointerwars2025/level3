# Pointer Wars: Linked List Edition Level 3
Level 3 is different from the prior levels. In this level you modify your
queue code from level 2 and improve the performance of the breadth first
search code provided in Level 2. The goal is to reduce the time per 
search to as close to 0 as you can.

Level 3 is a lot more reading and thinking, and arguably less coding.
Performance work often takes planning and thinking prior to implementation.
You will learn about the impact of branching, learn about CPU memory
systems, learn about kernel policies and their impact on performance,
and a few other things along the way, although this level is really
more about your willingness to read, comphrehend, and ask questions
versus raw coding ability.

The process by which we want you to optimize your code is somewhat 
scientific. DO NOT just start optimizing. We highly recommend that 
you visit our list of optimizations (see below). These are 
starting points to be sure, but also will provide you with the 
information necessary to predict what the upper bound of your 
performance improvement might be, and also other tradeoffs in that space.

The list is effectively a living document where we'll keep adding
optimizations as we think of them, or as participants continue to
write excellent code (we've seen some really cool performance
optimizations in code we've reviewed as part of this challenge).
